# My MacOS Dotfiles

I spend most of my MacOS time on the terminal, especially tmux + neovim + kitty and some other tools I find useful while boosting my productivity. You are free to use some of my configurations since they are minimal and lightweight. 

I usually use Linux on my main machine but prefer a MacBook Air while travelling. It's near to my main machine but tweaked for MacOS.
